<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to refine the Divine Aura website by adding a lightweight “fun beauty-tech” Virtual Try-On experience. This should be implemented without heavy AI or face-tracking.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Navigation:** Add a new link, Aura Virtual Studio, to the top navigation, pointing to a new  page.
2.  **New Page: Aura Virtual Studio ():**
    *   **Layout:** Must include an image upload section, category selector tabs (Lipstick, Blush, Strobe Cream), a shade selector, and an overlay simulation area.
    *   **Functionality:** Users can upload a selfie, select a product category and a demo shade. A color overlay (manually draggable and resizable) appears on the image. An intensity slider (Light/Medium/Bold) should control the overlay's opacity.
    *   **Demo Shades (Phase 1):**
        *   Lipstick: Peach Veil – Soft Warm Nude
        *   Blush: Soft Petal – Rosy Pink
        *   Strobe Cream: Pearl Glow – Champagne Highlight
    *   **Action:** An Add to Cart button should be present for the selected shade.
3.  **Product Page Integration:**
    *   On relevant product pages (Lipstick, Blush, Strobe), add a button: Try This Shade in Aura Studio.
    *   This button should link to the  page and pre-select the correct category and shade using query parameters (e.g., ).
4.  **Future-Proofing:**
    *   Add a boolean field  to the product data structure. This will allow new try-on shades to be added dynamically in the future without redesigning the page.
5.  **Homepage Entry Point:**
    *   Add a small, non-intrusive CTA block on the homepage with the text Not sure about shades? Try them instantly and a button linking to the Aura Virtual Studio.

**what currently exists?**
A complete frontend React application for the Divine Aura e-commerce website. The site includes Home, Shop, Aura Analysis, Consult, About, and Contact pages. It has a full product catalog defined in a static JS file () and a working cart system using React Context. The styling is done with Tailwind CSS, featuring a premium, pastel-themed aesthetic. The mobile navigation was recently improved to a horizontal scrollable bar.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent began the implementation of the Virtual Try-On feature. It successfully extracted the user-provided codebase and created the necessary, but currently empty, file structure for the new Aura Virtual Studio.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent and screenshot tool, as the feature is entirely on the frontend.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs. The focus is on new feature development.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Implement the Aura Virtual Studio Feature (P0)**
    *   **Where to resume:** The file structure for the feature has been created. The next step is to implement the UI and logic within these empty files:
        1.  ****: Build the main page layout, combining all sub-components.
        2.  ****: Implement the file input logic to handle selfie uploads.
        3.  ****: This is the core component. It needs to render the uploaded image and a draggable, resizable color overlay on top of it. Implement the intensity slider logic here. Consider using a library like  for this.
        4.  ** and **: Implement the state management for selecting product categories and shades.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** A functional Aura Virtual Studio page where users can upload an image and simulate trying on makeup shades.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: Update Data and Routing:**
        *   Modify  to include the  flag for the three demo products.
        *   Add the new  route in .
    *   **P0: Implement Integrations:**
        *   Add the Aura Virtual Studio link to the .
        *   Add the Try This Shade in Aura Studio button to , ensuring it passes the correct query parameters.
        *   Add the new CTA section to .
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   Refactor the Virtual Studio to dynamically load all products with  from , instead of being limited to the three demo shades.

**Completed work in this session**
*   Successfully extracted the user-provided project code from .
*   Created the placeholder file structure for the new Virtual Try-On feature, including  and its sub-components.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React Router
*   **State Management:** React Context API
*   **New Concepts:** Handling file uploads in React, using HTML Canvas or advanced CSS for image overlays, implementing drag-and-drop functionality, and parsing URL query parameters with React Router.

**key DB schema**
The project uses a mock DB at . A new field will be added to product objects:
*   : 

**changes in tech stack**
*   None. The agent might propose adding a lightweight library for drag-and-drop functionality (e.g., ).

**All files of reference**
*   **Newly Created (but empty):**
    *   : The main page for the new feature.
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
*   **To Be Modified:**
    *    (add route)
    *    (add nav link)
    *    (add CTA)
    *    (add Try This Shade button)
    *    (add  flag)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   No refactoring is needed. The newly created files require initial implementation.

**key api endpoints**
*   N/A (frontend-only feature).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The primary goal is a *lightweight* simulation. Avoid heavy AI/AR libraries. The core of the feature is a simple, manually placed color overlay on a static image.
*   The entire implementation logic for the Virtual Studio is pending. The agent must populate the empty component files that have been created.
*   The connection between the product pages and the virtual studio via query parameters () is a crucial part of the requirement.
*   The  flag in the product data is for future-proofing and must be included in this phase.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (msg 210):** Provided a detailed request to build a Virtual Try-On feature, including requirements for a new page, navigation updates, product page integration, and a homepage CTA. The user also uploaded a zip file of the current project codebase.
    *   **Status:** In Progress.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Functional:** The existing website is fully functional.
*   **Mocked:** All data is mocked in a local  file.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   None.

**Testing status**
*   **Test files created:** None.
*   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   N/A.

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent has just started the task and has not forgotten anything. The full implementation of the requested feature is pending.</analysis>
